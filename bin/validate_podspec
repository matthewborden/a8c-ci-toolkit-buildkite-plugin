# Usage: validate_podspec [OPTIONS] [PODSPEC(S)_PATH(S)...] 
#
#  - If no `PODSPEC_PATH` provided, will lint all `*.podspec` files found
#  - By default, the linting of each podspec will `--include-podspecs=*.podspec` any other podspec
#    found in the root of the repo, in order to support repos containing co-dependant pods which
#    needs to be linted and pushed in concert
#
# OPTIONS:
#  `--patch-cocoapods`:
#     Apply a patch to work around issues with older deployment targets — see https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/12033
#  `--allow-warnings`, `--sources=…`, `--private`, `--include-podspecs=…`, `--external-podspecs=…`:
#     Those options are passed to `pod lib lint` verbatim
#
